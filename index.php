		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Beth Macbeth</p>
		<p><strong>Age:</strong> 31</p>
		<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Beth is a stay at home mom with a 2 year old daughter and a newborn son. She is
			a long time user of Etsy and really enjoys the crafts and trinkets that other people have made. Beth has
			dabbled in making her own crafts before and is getting ready to put some of them up for sale for the first
			time. While she is very familiar with the purchasing process on Etsy, she has never sold anything on the
			site before, so it will be a new experience for her. Based on her familiarity with purchasing, she
			is confident about her ability to post her items and does not anticipate any problems.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Beth is devoted to Apple and has the latest iPhone 7, iPad Pro, a Macbook Air,
			and a 21.5" iMac.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes & Behaviors:</strong> Beth is very busy during the day taking care of her two kids. She
			often gets up early in the morning before her kids in order to have some quiet time to herself and drink
			coffee. This is when she will browse Etsy the most. Throughout the rest of the day, she will browse Etsy
			off and on while her kids are either napping or otherwise entertained. However her browsing sessions are
			often limited to 5 - 10 minutes. At night after her kids go to bed is when Beth will spend an hour working
			on her crafts as a way to relax before going to bed.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations & Needs:</strong> Beth is pretty familiar with the motions she goes through regularly
			on all of her devices, as well and the purchasing process on Etsy. However she sometimes requires assistance
			if she is performing a new task on her iPhone or computer. Beth will attempt to figure it out on her own for
			about 3 to 5 minutes before getting frustrated and quiting, only to ask her friend or husband about it later
			on if she remembers.</p>
